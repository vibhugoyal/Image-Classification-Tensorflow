# Image-Classification-Tensorflow

Created and trained a Neural Network model that, after the training, will be able to predict digits from hand-written images with a high degree of accuracy and along the way developed a basic understanding of how Neural Networks to develop a basic understanding of TensorFlow syntax with Keras as its front end.
